Climate is a music duo from North Texas. Climate has been creating music together since starting on a four track in a dorm room at University of Texas at Austin in 1997, racking up 14 full length albums and 5 EPs in that time. The first era of Climate (1997 - 2002) was generally experimental indie rock heavily influence by punk, post punk, and 90s indie music. The second era (2002 - 2009) was almost exclusively instrumental electronica influenced by reggae and dub. The last decade up to and including 2021's <i>Colorways</i> has been a mixture of indie songwriting blended with electronica, a genre Climate has termed "post smooth jazz".
