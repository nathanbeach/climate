  Climate is Nathan Beach and Grant Kuneman from North Texas. They both grew up in Richardson but met in Austin at the University of Texas in 1997. They soon started making music on a 4-track cassette recorder in a dorm room on campus. Climate self-released their first album, <i>Friends Have Names</i>, on cassette in 1998. They recorded their next couple albums (<i>Live for Success!</i> and <i>Bred Mice</i>) in a south Austin apartment. This initial era of Climate culminated in a KVRX Local Live performance in 1999 with Jad Fair performing in the band.

  After migrating back to North Texas, Climate released <i>Swallow All Letters</i> in 2000 on Hot Link Records, adding Bill Driegert on drums and percussion to the band. David Berman (of Silver Jews) described the album as "better than pretty good." Extensive live performances in support of the album followed with Driegert on drums and Christian Dille on bass. This period ended with a compilation <i>The Final Songs</i> in 2002.

  Climate spent the remainder of the '00s experimenting with electronic production techniques while releasing several mostly-instrumental electronica albums and EPs, and returning to indie pop form with 2010's <i>Risen From The Rails</i>. The 2010s brought forth the wintery lo-fi masterpieces in <i>The Peculiar End of December</i> and a collection of 32 1-minute electronic gems called <i>Thirty-Two Short Songs About Boats</i>.

  In 2017, Climate moved in next door to each other in the far north suburbs of Dallas, creating Climate Studios East and West in Allen, Texas. Climate reguarly meets in the "side yard" between the houses for music development discussions while idly managing the combined seven children between the two households. 2021's <i>Colorways</i> is the first result of this period of reunion. The album was created over Dropbox and Zoom through the covid-19 pandemic while in quarantine right next door to each other. <i>Colorways</i> reflects the paranoia and occassional euphoria of the time and analyzes the obligations of family and friends, both live and virtual.
