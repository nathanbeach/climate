"Peter's Knees"

The broken leaves are on the floor
They form on me a semi-royal wreath
The vines reach up for heaven-high
They almost cannot touch St. Peter’s Knees

He lets no persons in these days
We lost all desires to learn
I am up past the stars right now
I wish I were down on earth with you


"A Firefighter"

It's a day at the movies
And you are acting
So bold and brave
Up there on a screen

And you are a firefighter
You are a firefighter


In the day that's withholding
You will take your leave of me



"Chinese Pin"

All I see
The same old girls
I wrote about
This time last year

That same Chinese pin
Through that same
Never mind hair

If you cross
The street today
Do not bother
To look back
This way

All the diseases
Desperate grown
Doesn’t match the way
It is on your own

All the diseases
Desperate grown
Doesn’t match the way
I see you now


"Your Pants"



"Body Will"


"To Belong"
