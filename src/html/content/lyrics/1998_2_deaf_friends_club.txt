"Peter's Knees"

The broken leaves are on the floor
They form on me a semi-royal wreath
The vines reach up for heaven-high
They almost cannot touch St. Peter’s Knees

He lets no persons in these days
We lost all desires to learn
I am up past the stars right now
I wish I were down on earth with you


"Randy Grows"

Randy's dead
She lost her head and said
“Save his lungs for me”
Though Randy's dead
I can't just fake regret
And fight what had to be

And his being gone today
Is not the way to be
It's the way to live
And then she said
“Oh what would randy say, if he could say now?”

No one knows
How our randy grows
No one knows
How he liked to go
To the library
Wearing nothing but a sock
And a silly grin on his face
Naked as a horse

“Save his lungs for me”
“Save his arms for me”
“Save his neck for me”
“I will need these things”


"Lady To-Night"

Walzting time to other rhymes
That lay before me

Let me be your lady to-night
You show me how to dance right
Can you please bring me some drink
I am so thirsty for city lights

It’s okay when you bring me some gin
Can you believe the city we are in?
Can’t we leave Austin bald soon?
Back to Dallas and my room

Where can we get gravy for us?
This night it’s too cold to taste
Cowboys and Indians make friends
I’ll give you beads for a smoke

Let me be your lady to-night
You show me how to dance right
Can you please bring me some drink
I am so thirsty for city lights


"Ronald's Diet"

Drive time makes me crotchety
Here in this towns
The laws are there too long
To enforced lightly

Why cannot they get the traffic lights
Timed like the way Ronald drives
Stopping at lights is no fun
When there is no-one to hit

Eating times makes me crazy
Here in this towns
The laws are there too long
To enforced lightly

Why can't they fix the food items
Like Ronald eats daily
Eating is no fun when
You have got no one to chew it out

And they know
Oh yes, they know
All the foodstuffs
That make Ronald grow

Give him carrots for his hair
Give him corn for his health
Give him milk for his bones
Give him meat for his brain
Give him chili for his soul

And if he choose
He mixes food with other things
And if he chews
He masticates all kinds of food
And if he eats
He feels so full from hair to feet
And if he please
He digests all these things with ease

Making Ronald out of meat
Making Ronald out of milk
Making Ronald out of bread
Making Ronald out of fruits and vegetables

And he will always have some thing to eat
But he’ll missing those things in return
And they know oh they know
All the food groups that make Ronald grow


"Chinese Pin"

All I see
The same old girls
I wrote about
This time last year

That same Chinese pin
Through that same
Never mind hair

If you cross
The street today
Do not bother
To look back
This way

All the diseases
Desperate grown
Doesn’t match the way
It is on your own

All the diseases
Desperate grown
Doesn’t match the way
I see you now


"Wind Wind"

Engines humming inside
Tunnels passing me by
Blank white fields befriend
Window cracking the night
Fractured tendency strain
Colors falling in place
King to every case
Finger cracking the rain
Sliding upward in time
Fixing following rhymes
Stop here yes to free
Rolling inwardly
Tick’s tock forever block
Bridge to southern lanes
Toes taped to high planes
How could everything lock?

Wind wind wind wind
Come to blow
Come to blow a trees away
Come to blow a Greece away
Cannot wait until the day
That we’ll dream, drown, clown around
Summer will not beat my soul
At last at last
We roll in the grass
At last at last
We forget the past
Wind wind wind wind
