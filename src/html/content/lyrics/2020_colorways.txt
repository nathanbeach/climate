"New Birds Sing"

A coffee pot in the child's room
We place the poison in each corner
In hurried dreams that sleep
Recurring deathlessly
A tea kettle in the child's room

Break day
Hear the new birds sing
A satellite
In the night
Falls at our feet

We turn to the ante-choir
We tear up the photographs
A digital refrain
A physical restraint
A door ajar for the dark room

Day breaks
Feel the new bird sing
A parasite
Black and white
Flaps its wing

We always thought it might happen
Nightfall and with weapons
Moonlight on the lawn
Where two rights make a wrong

The lost smoke spills at the spin down
Pale blue fills in the foreground
A tapestry of groans
With meat left on the bones

The object on the windowsill
Is like the rain that runs uphill
And falls apart

The blackboard in the forest green
Has chalks of marks
And hoops and strings
That fall apart

Still at light in the short slide
Off down the street on two feet

Silent freight not to resuscitate
Hold the sound til it drowns


"Skip The Estuary"

Last summer was so cold
The cargo oversold
Haunting refrains
On captain's campaign

We tried to disentwine
Extend by tens and nine
Stroll up the strand
Strike up the band

A salty mix of gear
Fishing from the pier
Nets full of bream where
The tide meets the stream

If you've got shivers
Head down to the river
We think it's necessary
That you skip the estuary (this time)


"Velveteen Delusion"

Shaky hands will greet you
But should the shanking go too far...

Let's hear that song
Inside your head
If it isn't too long
In the back of the shed
You shouldn't have read
How the new disease can harm you

Under the skin
A fragile bone
Who'd strangle a wren
With the cord from a phone?
Who wouldn't condone
That subtle kind of curfew?

Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
We're living in a velveteen delusion

We'll be
Whatever we can make of it
Till we're real
Till we feel
Like we're real

Bleak thoughts are free
It fogs, it rains
Makes a come back at three
Paints some white on the stains
We haven't a pain
In the waning light of Tuesday

What's in the sack?
A want or a need
Or special visions to track
On a pallet of reeds
You don't have to bleed
Like a roller skating junior

Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
We're living in a veltveteen delusion

Later life will be
Whatever we can make of it
Till we die
Look alive
Till we die


"A Drop Of Blood"

The shallow cells are upended
A drop of blood and a warrant
Not this time

The daughter's featureless visage
The garden empty at morning
Two hands tied

Tender
Tender the fallen frame
Under
Under the polished blade

Tender
Tender the fallen frame
Under
Under the polished blade

We never liked that phase
A cinder in the flame
A lack of light
In the night
Falls at our feet

A little compromise
A set of hidden thighs
Attack of sighs
Make it right
Under the sheets

We said it's just a phase
But you never could keep pace
Keep that sweet look
And that sweet tooth
In your face

Bloodline in slow decay
We launched a slow decay
A splinter on the rain
But the puppy can stay
Two bruised eyes cry all night
Hands below cheeks

Perpender
Survive the cinder frame
Above remnants of our decay
You said it's just a phase

Perpender
Survive the cinder frame
Above remnants of our decay
We watched the slow decay

The shallow cells are upended
A drop of blood and a warrant
Not this time


"Delicate Transmission"

Stood for pictures at the park
Left them screaming for a lark
Made some food
For those tiny monarchs
And we heard all the bugs skitch
Right after it got dark

Ate some take out
And watched some news
Tweaked the settings on the snoo
Took the children to the zoo
Painted the kitchen a new hue

It was kind of a
Spanish gray
A knife
Locked door

Tired boots
Near the hand
In the neighbors den
"Don’t go"

Thoughts and bile
Parasite in the peristyle
Intuition of ours (and hours)

Batten the hatch
And batten the eyes

Thoughts and bile
Parasite in the peristyle
Buried under the bough

Batten the hatch
And batten the eyes

Thoughts and bile
Parasite in the peristyle

Cold red sun
Brittle moon
Breaks through

Lost in the cave
Here's your host
The ghost

We'll find
Our way back out
Surely


"The Last Television"

Bird songs sang
Not the last television
We flicker away
Down to the sound

To stay or go
We do not know
Can't you stay
To lose the light of day

So long
The theme song is so very wrong
So take us away
Away


"If You Go To Sleep"

A sixty watt bulb
Illuminates the family tree
The doctor's taken to sea
A discolored paperback
In an ancient galilee

A family car drives
Past big house and small trees
They named this street after me
A hidden cul-de-sac
Cold umbrellas and wet feet

Mid-day feels so fresh and renewed
It just enhances the mood
Under the cover of sine waves
It’s something we need anyway

Blinking
The baseball hits the bat
The policeman tipping his hat
He later rests his feet
On the back seat half asleep

Stop captain, stop
Do you not see, do you not see?
All the pages are torn off
Around high tea

Underground swell
By the church bells
We cannot sleep

Turn it around
Can't take the sound
Of your wet feet

It keeps me up all night
My doctor may have been right
To the third party call
The virus at high sea
Call sawbones
They cannot breathe

Thursday morning
We've got some things to do
Friday morning
Let's meet back here around 2:00
Saturday morning
She said she'll wait in the car
Sunday morning
So i can't really wander that far

The doctor may be right
The doctor may be right


"Wood And Glass"

Shards of glass in
The right hand or
Garden shears left
By the dwarf, Alberta

By the boxwood by
The corpse left by
The topiary

In the toolshed
On the wall
Is God in tears
A nail is his hand

Wood and glass sand
Pith and mask, canned
Paint and stain stand
Smell the rain

Our luxury home
With all the paving stones
Welcomes guests
With barks and purrs
The color of the stone is fool proof
The walls a cool blue
And curved stair cases, two


"Why Some Houses Burn"

Give the jib line some slack
As we lay on our backs
But keep a few rags
In our flight bag

Who can we trust?
Endless we dust!
Grind on the ring
As the digits are sliding

This is why some houses burn

The last pass was wrong
By a furlong
Round and spikey
'neath the gum tree

Fixed a broken bike spoke
'neath the old willow oak
And told some dad jokes

This is why some houses burn

Wade through the stream
On a split screen
The future will sag
Raise a pink flag

How many, how many, how many

Someday we'll learn
Why some houses burn
In a downturn


"Black Spruce"

Memories
They tend to follow you
Lagging strands
Behind the brand new

First we walked
And then we learned to crawl
Between the sheets
To save us all

Chose a path
And got struck by a train
On a hillock
Green with grain

Our last truce
Beneath a dead black spruce
A black spruce


"Element Of Time"

A distant relation
A clattered bone

Lungs are floating
Through the frigid air
Time is slowing
Down your morning prayer

Mend the brickwork
Watch the church burn
Don’t let go
Let go

I’ve come to watch you burn
