  <h2>"Velveteen Delusion"</h2>

  <div>
  This track is from Climate's 14th full-length release, <i>Colorways</i>. It's an intepretation of a basic early American pop song, and it's been intentionally stuck in the midst of an album with widely varied genres across tracks. The lyrics allude to a velveteen rabbit's transformation from a stuffed animal to something real, juxtaposed against the piquant mid-life ennui of being beaten down by children and general adult responsibilities... the likes of which will not let up until the sweet release of death.

  "Velveteen Delusion" started as a little riff on baritone ukulele that Nathan came up with, then Grant took it and developed the full instrumentation. Grant says, "I initially was trying to rewrite 'I Think We’re Alone Now' by Tommy James and the Shondells. Didn’t really end up that way though." Nathan wrote the lyrics based on Grant's vocal melody. This one was sung by Grant on main vocals and Nathan added in the chorus parts.

  <h2>Lyrics</h2>

  <pre>
  "Velveteen Delusion"

  Shaky hands will greet you
  But should the shanking go too far...

  Let's hear that song
  Inside your head
  If it isn't too long
  In the back of the shed
  You shouldn't have read
  How the new disease can harm you

  Under the skin
  A fragile bone
  Who'd strangle a wren
  With the cord from a phone
  Who wouldn't condone
  That subtle kind of curfew

  Lord have mercy
  Lord have mercy
  Lord have mercy
  We're living in a velveteen delusion

  We'll be whatever we can make of it
  Till we're real
  Till we feel
  Like we're real

  Bleak thoughts are free
  It fogs, it rains
  Makes a come back at three
  Paints some white on the stains
  We haven't a pain
  In the waning light of Tuesday

  What's in the sack?
  A want or a need
  Or special visions to track
  On a pallet of reeds
  You don't have to bleed
  Like a roller skating junior

  Lord have mercy
  Lord have mercy
  Lord have mercy
  We're living in a velveteen delusion

  Later life
  Will be whatever we can make of it
  Till we die
  Look alive
  Till we die
