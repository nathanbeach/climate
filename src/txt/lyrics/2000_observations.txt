"Rock And Roll In Dallas, Texas"

Rock and roll in Dallas, Texas
Has got a different kind of beat
Trucks are thumping down the highway
Debutantes are out to eat
They’re on the street

I was out driving just yesterday
In those downtown Dallas streets
Don’t you love it on the plains babe?
The concrete streets mark the way

That the cattle made their ways
Up to the north end of the state
The Yankees maybe play
But the Rangers play it straight

Got a biscuit with my eggs
And white gravy on my plate
We’ve got rock and roll to play
We're going to rock the southern states

Going to rock and roll in Dallas, Texas
Going to rock and rock and rock
And roll in Dallas, Texas

Sidekicks are kicking it at reunion
The Mavericks are shooting up some hoops
I think I just lost my car keys
I’ll be taking DART home to-night

But we’re turning up the amps
And we’re dropping down the nutz
Grant’s screaming on the slide guitar
And the garage door
The garage door is up

Rock and roll in the suburbs
Where the old ladies tend to dance
Pulling poodles down the sidewalk
And they’re having trouble with their pants

When they hear us play the rock and roll
And the garage door is up
They hear us play the rock and roll
And the garage door is up
Rock and roll the neighborhood
And the garage door is up
You can hear us on the highway
When the garage door is up
Only rock and roll is heard
When the garage door is up
Cause rock and roll is back
And the garage door is up
The R&B is back
When the garage door is up
Rock and roll the suburbs
When the garage door is up
Rock and rock and roll
When the garage door is up
Rock and rock and roll
When the garage door is up


"Show Me Your Fingers"

Have you changed my question
Or asked another one of me?
I’ve abandoned my plans completely
To make you need me

Show me your fingers
Count them, darling
That’s how many times that I’ve loved you
And nine times is enough that’s all I can do
I want something new

As I live alone in Dallas
Texas, my love, has never looked so cold
A snowflake falls uniquely
But when it lands we’ll see

Show me your fingers
Count them, darling
That’s how many times I’ve loved you
And nine times is enough that’s all I can do
I want something new

Mr. Clarke has got wine for you
Only the best, he knows what to do
Mr. Davis is putting on the moves
He’s sixty years old with so much to prove
Mr. Prather he writes you a book
There’s no telling how long it took
Mr. Henty is picking his swords
He’s fighting in a duel over who gets you
Mr. Ford, his name is Ernie
He sings you one about how

The love is gone
Love is dead
Love is wrong
And you once said
That life’s too long
It never moves
But hear these words
They might remind you


"Tomorrow May Be The Day"

I watched you turn dead
In that hospital bed
The nurse and your cat
A crutch and a hat

With pillow in hand
What put to your face
Gloves on nightstand
A grimy suitcase

The collar was loose
I’d shucked off my boots
Crackers and juice
And doctors in suits

Looking at your rigid limbs
It’s difficult not to think
About the time I spent
Laying on the couch
Sleepless
One eye on the door
One eye sealed shut
Until the door opened
And in you came
Whisky on your breath
Death in your eye
Your shallow skin
Parched red
Making making me
Taste the fear
Taste the pain
Taste the love
We used to share
My dear
This is the day
I’ve always looked forward to
The day when i could say

You’re very much alive
You’re breathing just fine
But tomorrow may be the day
You’ll never know, dear

Darling, there’s something here in this sack
The garden and the trees
And the flowers and the bees
They’ll never have a chance to grow back


"Sally’s On The Phone"

This happens every time you call my line
I’ve got plenty say
About frat house propaganda
And the lengthening line
For contracting disease

I don’t feel so alone
When Sally’s on the phone
I’m asking her about
The next time she’s driving home

Sally Marie, she's a sad girl
But she smiles bright blue
When I tell her the news
About how rescuers aren't working
It's Christmas Eve
So they can go home

And Ronald Reagan's had back rubs
And lots of new friends for living this far
And with our senator in a space ship
Then who speak for us while he's gone?

I don’t feel so alone
When Sally’s on the phone
I’m asking her about
The next time she’s driving home

And Sally says,
I am a human being
With doors and ceilings and floors like you
I’ve even got a kitchen
And a cat named Richard just like you
I know the names of your kinfolk
And have had mine renamed like yours
We’ve got the same initials
And now my birthday is the same as yours

I don’t feel so alone
When Sally’s on the phone
I’m asking her about
The next time she’s driving home


"Observations On Friends And Friendship"

I’ll ask you one question
What are friends for?
I’ll tell you the answer to that one
Friends are for caring and helping
Friends are able to accept when you have done wrong
Friends are forgiving
All this adds up and makes you perfect
The many jams you have helped me out of
Like the time when I was broke
And I smashed the glass bowl in the shop

Did you call me clumsy?
No

You just paid for the bowl
Then refused to let me pay you back
And the time when I broke my arm
By trying to fly off the trampoline

Did you laugh?
No

You talked to me all the way
To the hospital
And held my hand
All this talk of how wonderful you are
Is making it hard for me to tell you the bad news
My family is moving to California and
Naturally I have to go with them
I don’t know how I will last without you there
To help me out of my messes
But I know that nobody will ever take up
The large portion of my heart that you own
You will forever be my friend
And I hope I will be yours too


"Happy Birthday To Me"

Dallas, Texas morning
Bloody Mary at ten
On a special day like this
They should have kept the kids in

It’s Saturday morning and the cars back up
As I’m standing in the yard with a ladle and a cup
It’s little Mary’s birthday with an end so abrupt
They’ll have to clean it up with a bucket and a mop

Mrs. Hansen had the girls
At her house for breakfast today
Slumber party PJs
Eleven candles on the cake, hooray!

It’s Saturday morning and the cars back up
As I’m standing in the yard with a ladle and a cup
It’s little Mary’s birthday with an end so abrupt
They’ll have to clean it up with a bucket and a mop

Coca-Cola™ and cupcakes
Turn on the faucet for noise
I guess her friends will have to enjoy
All her brand new toys

It’s Saturday morning and the cars back up
As I’m standing in the yard with a ladle and a cup
It’s little Mary’s birthday with an end so abrupt
They’ll have to clean it up with a bucket and a mop

Elementary school used to leave me cold
It’s so hard to get a fix when you’re eight years old


"In The Harbor"

Some people like him but some folks don’t
Rusty sails in the harbor flap just like
The bird that's in the bush
The glue in his hand
The bass drum thumps in the rock and roll band

She fell down the stairway but tucked in her skirt
Scabby knees in the hallway are red just like
The apple that fell from the tree to the dirt
She’s always wearing his favorite shirt

The razor takes a nick off the business man
He’s standing in the bathroom in just his knee-socks
While his wife is in Cannes with an all-over tan
He’s back home eating chunky soup from a can

Charmers on the edge of the lake
Rusty nails beneath rake
Shorty sings the songs in tune
Cindy shakes the dust-filled broom
Sockets sucked into the head
Falling snow onto the dead

Some folks like it but some folks don’t
When you tickle their clem
With a thought so enlightening
It makes them think
Imagine they’d think
About the top 40 music out on the ice rink


"Somewhere Toward The Back"

When your arm touched mine while in the bank line
You became a piece of my mind
Synapse and cardboard the pieces shift and crack
I stuck you in somewhere toward the back

Pale white even grey the hand that shook the arm to-day
A fleshy mass filled with DNA
Or covered in lime in the casket next to mine
But you don’t have to worry about that for some time

You might slide your arm under the pillow to-night
To find some place cool and out of sight
But please don’t forget to turn out the bathroom light
Floss your teeth and brush with Dent-o-Brite™


"Today Is The Day"

Blood in the sink there is no rival
But clean white sheets
To your friends in the bible
If you wash your face make it red
Take off your socks before you get in bed
It’s not the day it’s night that I dread, thinking

Not this time not this way
As a hot bullet rattles in your empty head
Not this time not this way
You’re maybe going to lose you life today

Kiss me now or never again
Brush your hair then count to ten
Beige bath towel a fountain pen
And folding chairs for the other men
What will you say when it all begins?

Not this time not this way
As a hot bullet rattles in your empty head
Not this time not this way
You’re maybe gonna make me mad today

I can see the strain in your eyeballs now
As you cross the room take a bow
Sorry it just won’t work out somehow
A few more minutes the time allows
Your naked legs it’s this night that I dread, screaming

Not this time not this way
As a hot bullet rattles in your empty head
Not this time not this way
You’re maybe gonna make me mad today

Blood in the sink
There is no rival
But clean white sheets
For your friends in the bible


"Rock And Roll In Dallas, Texas (Reprise)"

Rock and roll in Dallas, Texas
Has got a different kind of beat
Trucks are thumping down the highway
Debutantes are out to eat
They’re on the street

I was out driving just yesterday
In the downtown Dallas streets
Don’t you love it on the plains babe?
The concrete streets mark the way

That the cattle made their ways
Up to the north end of the state
The Yankees maybe play
But the Rangers play it straight

Got a biscuit with my eggs
And white gravy on my plate
We’ve got rock and roll to play
We're going to rock the southern states

Going to rock and rock and rock
And roll in Dallas, Texas
Going to rock and roll in Dallas, Texas

The Sidekicks are kicking it at reunion
The Mavericks are shooting up some hoops
I think I just lost my car keys
I’ll be taking DART home to-night

Because we’re turning up the amps
And we’re dropping down the nutz
Grant’s screaming on the guitar
And the garage door is up

Rock and roll in the suburbs
Where the old ladies like to dance
Pulling poodles down the sidewalk
And they’re having trouble with their pants

When they hear us play the rock and roll
And the garage door is up
