"Ronald's Diet"

Drive time makes me crotchety
Here in this towns
The laws are there too long
To enforced lightly

Why cannot they get the traffic lights
Timed like the way Ronald drives
Stopping at lights is no fun
When there is no-one to hit

Eating times makes me crazy
Here in this towns
The laws are there too long
To enforced lightly

Why can't they fix the food items
Like Ronald eats daily
Eating is no fun when
You have got no one to chew it out

And they know
Oh yes, they know
All the foodstuffs
That make Ronald grow

Give him carrots for his hair
Give him corn for his health
Give him milk for his bones
Give him meat for his brain
Give him chili for his soul

And if he choose
He mixes food with other things
And if he chews
He masticates all kinds of food
And if he eats
He feels so full from hair to feet
And if he please
He digests all these things with ease

Making Ronald out of meat
Making Ronald out of milk
Making Ronald out of bread
Making Ronald out of fruits and vegetables

And he will always have some thing to eat
But he'll missing those things in return
And they know oh they know
All the food groups that make Ronald grow


"Randy Grows"

Randy's dead
She lost her head and said
'Save his lungs for me'
Though Randy's dead
I can't just fake regret
And fight what had to be

And his being gone today
Is not the way to be
It's the way to live
And then she said
'Oh what would randy say, if he could say now?'

No one knows
How our randy grows
No one knows
How he liked to go
To the library
Wearing nothing but a sock
And a silly grin on his face
Naked as a horse

'Save his lungs for me'
'Save his arms for me'
'Save his neck for me'
'I will need these things'


"Happy Now"

If you are going to die
While I am alive
Do not forget to write
To make things go by

End all thinking here
Force feed me some beer
Then I will have to stay
Dancing the time away

How we feared strange things
We lived in the frame
Why do I see
You and no me?

Am I really there?
Are those fingers mine?
I cannot see me here
Am I really there?

I only see the you
Your skin is turned blue
Why are you blue?
Anything I can do?

It must be warm inside
We'll go for a ride
The car is waiting outside
Or we just stay here, let's hide

From all the people outside
They all know that you're mine
We pour out fear with the wine
We used to do this all the time

Your body will warm in the fire
Hey where is that fine old desire?
Is it growing in the fire?
Is it growing in the fire?

Or I can warm you up this how
Or I can warm you up this how
I am so happy now
I am so happy now
I am so happy now
I am so happy now


"Roscoe's Driveway"

Driving fast Sunday morning
Things for Roscoe in the back seat
I don't I don't I don't
Get things for any other

Oranges rolling down my wind
Silly looks will make him wonder
Derful derful der
Full of wonder will be Roscoe

Greeting friends in the driveway
Christmas cards from El Paso
I'll go I'll go I'll go
In the door and run home

Do he feel sorry for me
Anymore is better than the former
I know I know I know
He gives me lots of loving

Greeting friends in the driveway
Christmas cards from El Paso
I'll go I'll go I'll go
in the door and run home

It is coming back home
Starting to break
Nothing is fake
Nothing alone
When it's coming back home
Starting to break
Nothing is fake


"Peter's Knees"

The broken leaves are on the floor
They form on me a semi-royal wreath
The vines reach up for heaven-high
They almost cannot touch St. Peter's Knees

He lets no persons in these days
We lost all desires to learn
I am up past the stars right now
I wish I were down on earth with you


"Lady To-Night"

Walzting time to other rhymes
That lay before me

Let me be your lady to-night
You show me how to dance right
Can you please bring me some drink
I am so thirsty for city lights

It's okay when you bring me some gin
Can you believe the city we are in?
Can't we leave Austin bald soon?
Back to Dallas and my room

Where can we get gravy for us?
This night it's too cold to taste
Cowboys and Indians make friends
I'll give you beads for a smoke

Let me be your lady to-night
You show me how to dance right
Can you please bring me some drink
I am so thirsty for city lights


"Smoke Always"

I am sorry that the smoke always rises
From the bonfire in your house
There are so many rooms to grow
So I do not get in the way
Of the things you have to do today

This beer has solidified
On the chair in your living room
And I wonder why there is so much to do
Why cannot you
Make me some tea
Or give me a smile

For all the things today
That you must do
All the things
You


"Wind Wind"

Engines humming inside
Tunnels passing me by
Blank white fields befriend
Window cracking the night
Fractured tendency strain
Colors falling in place
King to every case
Finger cracking the rain
Sliding upward in time
Fixing following rhymes
Stop here yes to free
Rolling inwardly
Tick's tock forever block
Bridge to southern lanes
Toes taped to high planes
How could everything lock?

Wind wind wind wind
Come to blow
Come to blow a trees away
Come to blow a Greece away
Cannot wait until the day
That we'll dream, drown, clown around
Summer will not beat my soul
At last at last
We roll in the grass
At last at last
We forget the past
Wind wind wind wind


"Chinese Pin"

All I see
The same old girls
I wrote about
This time last year

That same Chinese pin
Through that same
Never mind hair

If you cross
The street today
Do not bother
To look back
This way

All the diseases
Desperate grown
Doesn't match the way
It is on your own

All the diseases
Desperate grown
Doesn't match the way
I see you now


"Will Call"

And when will you call me out there?
Oh, and this fun times we bear
For my black eye
My black eye
My black eye
Oh my

No more in the house here are you
And when will you give me a new
A new black eye
My black eye
My black eye
Oh my

There is beer in the cooling machine
No need to eat them today
My black eye
My black eye
My black eye
Oh my

When we are in Dallas again
I hope you'll be my special friend
To my black eye
My black eye
My black eye
Oh my


"Olden Days"

I ask myself how
Rode home on streets
On a bicycle built for one
Which he could not take to home
Did he carry this book
Which has his notations?
Whom did he Christen?
And what was he thinking?
Was it of Texas or
The long ride home?
The long ride home
The long ride home
The long ride home


"Dark Gone"

The room has gone dark
Except one Christmas light
It is cold out on the ocean tonight
When, if ever, come to me
And we'll go away to the sea
There is no-one will miss us here
If you walk down there with me
And I will show you the morning sun
If you push me out into the sea
