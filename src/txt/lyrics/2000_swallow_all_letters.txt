"Sally's On The Phone"

This happens every time you call my line
I've got plenty say
About the state of things in my life
And the weather to-day
Then I feel okay

You see, I don't feel so alone
When Sally's on the phone
And I'm asking her about the next time she's driving home

Sally Marie is a sad girl but she smiled bright blue
When I told her the good news
About how all my friends are dead now except for her
So I don't have to choose
Between the stiff and fragrant corpses and her little hand
All fleshy and new
And with her long lost love like a spaceship in my empty mind
I've got something to do

You see, I don't feel so alone
When Sally's on the phone
And I'm asking her about the next time she's driving home

And Sally says
I am a human being with doors and ceilings and floor like you
I've even got a kitchen and a cat named Richard just like you
I know the names of your servants and have had mine renamed like yours
We've got the same initials, November birthdays, and brand of shoes

You see, I don't feel so alone
When Sally's on the phone
And I'm asking her about the next time she's driving home


"Show Me Your Fingers"

Have you changed my question
Or asked another one of me?
I've abandoned my plans completely
To make you need me

Show me your fingers
Count them, darling
That's how many times I've loved you
And nine times is enough that's all I can do
I want something new

As I live alone in Dallas
Texas, my love, has never looked so cold
A snowflake falls uniquely
But when it lands we'll see

Show me your fingers
Count them, darling
That's how many times I've loved you
And nine times is enough that's all I can do
I want something new

Mr. Clarke has got wine for you
Only the best, he knows what to do
Mr. Davis is putting on the moves
He's sixty years old with so much to prove
Mr. Prather writes you a book
There's no telling how long it took
Mr. Henty is picking his swords
He's fighting in a duel over who gets you
Mr. Ford, his name is Ernie, sings you one about how

The love is gone
Love is dead
Love is wrong
And you once said
That life's too long
It never moves
But hear these words
They might remind you


"Fashion!"

Tell him
It's Sad
With secondary sorrow
They say
Something that you borrowed
Having empty chests of drawers
Has entered your main line
Eyes closed
Won't you
Stumble down the runway
Today
Drifting towards Monday
Buy something at a department store
Television currency

Fashion! Fashion! Fashion! Fashion!
In the empty margin
In the empty margin
Fashion! Fashion! Fashion! Fashion!
In the empty margin
In the empty margin

Skinny legs
You must
Folding up nicely
Look the same
Sedentary red sea
As everyone we see
Celebrity tributary
Mud caked
On TV
Over lime green eyes
On the screen
Water worth gem hides
Or you can't be friends with me
In your worthless currency

Fashion! Fashion! Fashion! Fashion!
In the empty margin
In the empty margin
Fashion! Fashion! Fashion! Fashion!
In the empty margin
In the empty margin

Tuesday morning
You're home
And a blinked eye
Your mobile phone
Heaven in a blue sky
Starbucks cup and SUV
Farm life never seemed so sweet out here
Are great
On the dirty street is home
They are really great
Nice shoes and a phone
Buyers forget their misery
Lots of new friends to meet

Fashion! Fashion! Fashion! Fashion!
In the empty margin
In the empty margin
Fashion! Fashion! Fashion! Fashion!
In the empty margin
In the empty margin


"Take Me Home Now"

I woke up to-day
And my friends had all gone to the beach
I wish I were there, too
Sunscreen in my eyes
Hot white sand in my hands
Sun-burnt lips laughing
Choking on salt water
Take me home now


"Tomorrow May Be The Day"

I watched you turn dead
In that hospital bed
The nurse and your cat
A crutch and a hat

With pillow in hand
What put to your face
Gloves on nightstand
A grimy suitcase

The collar was loose
I'd shucked off my boots
Crackers and juice
And doctors in suits

Looking at your rigid limbs
It's difficult not to think
About the time I spent
Laying on the couch
Sleepless
One eye on the door
One eye sealed shut
Until the door opened
And in you came
Whisky on your breath
Death in your eye
Your shallow skin
Parched red
Making making me
Taste the fear
Taste the pain
Taste the love
We used to share
My dear
This is the day
I've always looked forward to
The day when i could say

You're very much alive
You're breathing just fine
But tomorrow may be the day
You'll never know, dear

Darling, there's something here in this sack
The garden and the trees
And the flowers and the bees
They'll never have a chance to grow back


"1999"

I can't face the days
Without her here at night
And eight long years to go
In my lonely life
For the little folds in her eyelids
The gentle sighs in the dark
The way down as a failure
Isn't too far

I wouldn't feel better if it were the real thing
Ending the summer with crying and fear
Nineteen ninety-nine was such a long year

I'm so blue and beat down
So tired from from traveling
But I can't seem to find room
At your inn
The wine stain surrounds us
On the pillow that you chewed
But despite your love for murder
I'd rather be you

I wouldn't feel better if it were the real thing
Ending the summer with crying and fear
Nineteen ninety-nine was such a long year

My eyes are tired beasts
But it doesn't matter in the least
If you'd marry me
We'd kill the priest
And all the congregation
And i know you'd cry
To have eight long years to go
In your lonely life

I wouldn't feel better if it were the real thing
Ending the summer with crying and fear
Nineteen ninety-nine was such a long year


"Happy Birthday To Me"

Dallas, Texas morning
Bloody Mary at ten
On a special day like this
They should have kept the kids in

It's Saturday morning and the cars back up
As I'm standing in the yard with a ladle and a cup
It's little Mary's birthday with an end so abrupt
They'll have to clean it up with a bucket and a mop

Mrs. Hansen had the girls
At her house for breakfast today
Slumber party PJs
Eleven candles on the cake, hooray!

It's Saturday morning and the cars back up
As I'm standing in the yard with a ladle and a cup
It's little Mary's birthday with an end so abrupt
They'll have to clean it up with a bucket and a mop

Coca-Cola and cupcakes
Turn on the faucet for noise
I guess her friends will have to enjoy
All her brand new toys

It's Saturday morning and the cars back up
As I'm standing in the yard with a ladle and a cup
It's little Mary's birthday with an end so abrupt
They'll have to clean it up with a bucket and a mop

Elementary school used to leave me cold
It's so hard to get a fix when you're eight years old


"Julie's Clothes"

Driving to the lake
A day for sailing boats
Chase is in the back
Ron is in the front
Julie's at the wheel
She's wearing Julie's clothes

Ron works at the garage
Julie works at the bank
Chase he has
A crippling disease
He's only eight
And he tugs on Julie's clothes

Ron left work at noon
Julie packed her bags
They packed a lunch
Of cake and punch
Their swimming suits
And other parts of Julie's clothes

Veering off the road
The car burst into flames
Witnesses claim
They had no chance
They highway lanes
Were strewn with Julie's clothes

Drifting in the wind
Ignited gasoline
And burning socks
And linen shorts
I'm looking for a skirt
While picking up Julie's clothes

I remember you
In starkest black and white
The way you held
That boy so tight
With Ron's head cracked
I thought you'd never go


"Hitting Costs Nothing"

If you're awake I would just love for you to come on by!
You told me it wasn't on you
You told me it was at some place downtown
Well, I'm going to have to beat you blue on the sofa
I don't know why you won't answer me
But hitting costs nothing since kissing isn't free anymore

The bird's head sinks in the bird bath
The pencil on your arm will leave marks in the dark
The park's dried up the swings won't swing
But hitting costs nothing since kissing isn't free anymore

Sally, forget all your problems
I'm here i hope I can be on your team
The news is not as bad as it seems but you scream
I don't know why you won't answer me
But hitting costs nothing since kissing isn't free anymore

I am not sure whether or not you
Check your message service everyday
I thought I saw your car in the driveway in the shade at least
That is where it doesn't get so hot, so hot
But hitting costs nothing since kissing isn't free anymore


"In The Harbor"

Some people like him but some folks don't
Rusty sails in the harbor flap just like
The a&r man who's shaking his hand
As the bass drum thumps in the rock and roll band

She fell down the stairwell but tucked in her skirt
Scabby knees in the hallway are red just like
The apple that fell from the tree to the dirt
She's always wearing his favorite shirt

The razor takes a nick off the business man
He's standing in the bathroom in just his knee-socks
While his wife is in Cannes with an all-over tan
He's back home eating chunky soup from a can

Charmers on the edge of the lake
Rusty nails beneath rake
Shorty sings the songs in tune
Cindy shakes the dust-filled broom
Sockets sucked into the head
Falling snow onto the dead

Some folks like it but some folks don't
When you're talking to them
Or someone just like them
It makes them think
Imagine if they'd think
About the top 40 music out on the ice rink


"The Executive Spouse"

Filled up boxes with ship sails
Worked a while with a spade and a pail
There's little reason to stay on the job
With all the people and the banks I could rob

And that's made us rich now, Cindy
Now we're the rich kids, Cindy

Buying power has made me withdraw
From the salesmen and the shops on my road
What do I need lately?
A peaceful kitchen and a hammer and nails

And that's made us rich kids, Cindy
Oh, we're so rich now, Cindy

Shoes and furs and Mercedes
A wife's a great investment
In flesh and hair
And a nice set of toenails

And let's make some rich kids, Cindy
Let's make some rich kids, Cindy


"Somewhere Toward The Back"

When your arm touched mine while in the bank line
You became a piece of my mind
Synapse and cardboard the pieces shift and crack
I stuffed you in somewhere toward the back

Pale white even grey the hand that shook the arm to-day
A fleshy mass filled with DNA
Covered in lime in the casket next to mine
But you don't have to worry about that for some time

You might slide your arm under the pillow to-night
To find some place cool and out of sight
But don't forget to turn out the bathroom light
Floss your teeth and brush with Dent-o-Brite™


"They Rolled Up The Rug"

I haven't been to Dallas since Texas
Andrew's on the stage with his baton
Each corner brings a new intersection
Of lines in this building I say
Brown-haired girl leans over the loge

She says how do you like the show so far?
Mr. Hough can hit the keys really well
I say, afterwards we could drive up to Richardson
She rests her hand on her thigh

Did you see they rolled up the rug?
Yes, it used to be here and people would always trip on it

Making tracks on I-75
Traffic slows on the highway
Driving north to Richardson
With the daughter of Mr. Adler

Did you know they rolled up the rug?


"Grey And Black Unswitched Tracks"

Where was I?
It's coming back
Cars move past in grey and black
Railway station
Unswitched tracks
Sixty years without a clack
Make friends in the afternoon
It's morning now but won't be soon
Lungs blow out a pipe of steam
Feet step down start to breathe
In a wind that can't be seen
Frenchman wants to intervene

Concierge five foot three
Bus to pier it drives past me
Take a left or right you'll see
Bakery match company
Walking down an avenue
Baguette crust beneath my shoe
Crosswalk little man is red
Someone English has just said
Thirteen high school children dead
Tourist caps are on their heads

Find the place with beds and sheets
Reservations not til three
Take the load off of my feet
Read a map with lines for streets
Winding thick the boulevard
Spanish children in the yard
Playing tag and pick up sticks
One will grow up and make bricks
One will grow up cut cow licks
One will die young cold and sick

Pick the feet up to the road
No more hotel lobby moat
So much for this famous town
Spend some hours walk around
Spill the water on the walk
Passing girls like to talk
Do not let them see my hand
Bandaged cut passing sedan
In the bus towards the lake
Hear no words don't understand

Walking down bright alleyway
Bushes line this sun-filled day
Olympic games were underway
Cars parked here i heard them say
Need some food i hate to eat
Must take body off of feet
Swiss girl at the sandwich stand
Lipped in French a crimson band
Communicate embarrassment
Saw the way her body bent

Eat my sandwich near her
Watch the churchyard saints interred
Americans sit on the curb
Hips in love I won't disturb
Walk back down the hill to take
Time to think at the lake
Should I take the train back home
Bathers sunning in the foam
Or go find a vacant room
Shopkeeper brushes with his broom

Go to the back past the tracks
Open the door just a crack
Grey and black unswitched tracks

At this house girls stay in
Aunt Jane knocks door opens
On the cot on the porch
Grey and black unswitched tracks

Neighbors tell her daddy knows
Socks on ledge mended toes
Apple tree arbor leaves
Grey and black unswitched tracks

Dew on grass moonlit tub
Rust on rake worms and grubs
Girlfriend in the 4h club
Grey and black unswitched tracks

Burn the barn he won't care
Take the cow he won't care
Take the daughter he won't care
Grey and black unswitched tracks

Barbed-wire fence in my jeans
Wants to know what it means
I say it's not what it seems
Grey and black unswitched tracks

Where was I?
It's coming back
Cars move past in grey and black
Railway station unswitched track
Sixty years without a clack


"Today Is The Day"

Blood in the sink there is no rival
But clean white sheets
To your friends in the bible
If you wash your face make it red
Take off your socks before you get in bed
It's not the day it's night that I dread, thinking

Not this time not this way
As a hot bullet rattles in your empty head
Not this time not this way
You're maybe going to lose you life today

Kiss me now or never again
Brush your hair then count to ten
Beige bath towel a fountain pen
And folding chairs for the other men
What will you say when it all begins?

Not this time not this way
As a hot bullet rattles in your empty head
Not this time not this way
You're maybe gonna make me mad today

I can see the strain in your eyeballs now
As you cross the room take a bow
Sorry it just won't work out somehow
A few more minutes the time allows
Your naked legs it's this night that I dread, screaming

Not this time not this way
As a hot bullet rattles in your empty head
Not this time not this way
You're maybe gonna make me mad today

Blood in the sink
There is no rival
But clean white sheets
For your friends in the bible


"Rock and Roll in Dallas, Texas"
(additional lyrics by Michael Blount, Jr.)

Hello, my future girlfriend
This is what I sound like

Rock and roll in Dallas, Texas
Has helped me back up on my feet
Trucks still pass by on the highway
Debutantes are still out to eat
They parked on my street

I was riding the bus yesterday
On a downtown Dallas street
Don't you love it on the plains, babe?
This asphalt lot marks the place

That the hopefuls spent their days
Walking up and down the street
With whiskey in their smiles
And leather on their feet

They had biscuits with their toast
And gravy on their plates
Said the Yankees maybe play
But the Rangers play it straight

All the Sidekicks and kicking at Reunion
The Mavericks are shooting up some hoops
My girlfriend lost my car keys
I'll be taking DART home tonight

But we're turning up the amps
And we're dropping down the nutz
Grant's screaming on the guitar
And the garage door
The garage door is up

Rock and roll in the suburbs
Has got a cleaner kick drum beat
Level roads and well-built sidewalks
Blades of grass under my feet

And they hear us play the rock and roll
With the garage door is up
Seen drooping streaks and Rufus leaks
The garage door is up
See white and blue hair and ermine stoles
When our garage door is up
See plastic spoons and cereal bowls
When our garage door is up

Rock and roll is important
If our garage door is up
Rock and roll is back
If our garage door is up
Rock and roll in Dallas, Texas
Our garage door is up
Rock and rollers in Dallas, Texas
Our garage door is up
Close the garage door
Our garage door is up
Rock and roll in Dallas, Texas
Our garage door is up

Bye
Thanks for stopping by
