"New Birds Sing"

A coffee pot in the child's room
We place the poison in each corner
In hurried dreams that sleep
Recurring deathlessly
A tea kettle in the child's room

Break day
Hear the new birds sing
A satellite in the night
Falls at our feet

We turn to the ante-choir
We tear up the photographs
A digital refrain
A physical restraint
A door ajar for the dark room

Day breaks
Feel the new bird sing
A parasite black and white
Flaps its wing

We always thought it might happen
Nightfall and with weapons
Moonlight on the lawn
Where two rights
Make a wrong

The lost smoke
Spills at the spin down
Pale blue fills in the foreground
A tapestry of groans
With meat left on the bone

The object on the windowsill
Is like the rain that runs uphill
And falls apart

The blackboard in the forest green
Has chalks of marks
And hoops and strings
That fall apart

Still at light
In the short slide
Off down the street
On two feet

Silent freight
Not to resuscitate
Hold the sound
Til it drowns


"Smiling The Right Way"

We keep sending it
Via standing waves
We keep feeding it
Through the interface

Ends definitive
Corners closely cropped
Split infinitives
Blur the bitter top

Smiling the right way now
We have made it back home somehow
To a sanguine lair in the hay
For our babbling stream
Of weak solutions

Smiling the right way now
We have made our way down somehow
To a coracle in the bay
Take a seat and finally learn how

Soon we'll be gone
But we'll leave with a serenade
About the moon on the lawn
And the plans we made

Free, right or wrong
It's not worth remembering
Now we're gonna have to move along
We're gonna have to move along


"A Drop Of Blood"

The shallow cells are upended
A drop of blood and a warrant
Not this time

The daughter's featureless visage
The garden empty at morning
Two hands tied

Tender
Tender the fallen frame
Under
Under the polished blade

Tender
Tender the fallen frame
Under
Under the polished blade

We never liked that face
A cinder in the flame
A lack of light
In the night
Falls at our feet

A little compromise
A set of hidden thighs
Attack of sighs
Make it right
Under the sheets

We said it's just a phase
But you never could keep pace
Keep that sweet look
And that sweet tooth
In your face

Bloodline in slow decay
We launched a slow decay
A splinter on the rain
Bruised eyes, cry all night
Hands below cheeks

Perpender
Survive the cinder frame
Above remnants of our decay

Perpender
Survive the cinder frame
Above the remnants of decay

The shallow cells are upended
A drop of blood and a warrant
Not this time


"Delicate Transmission"

Stood for pictures at the park
Left them screaming for a lark
Made some food for those tiny monarchs
And we heard all the bugs skitch
Right after it got dark

Ate some take out
Watched some news
Tweaked the settings on the snoo
Took the children to the zoo
Painted the kitchen a new hue
It was kind of a

Spanish gray
A knife
Locked door

Tired boots 
Near the hand
In the neighbor's den
"Don't go"

Thoughts and bile 
Parasite in the peristyle
Intuition of ours and hours

Batten the hatch
And batten the eyes

Thoughts and bile 
Parasite in the peristyle
Buried under the bough 

Batten the hatch
And batten the eyes

Thoughts and bile 
Parasite in the peristyle

Son,
We'll find
Our way out
Surely


"Velveteen Delusion"

Shaky hands will greet you
But should the shanking go too far...

Let's hear that song
Inside your head
If it isn't too long
In the back of the shed
You shouldn't have read
How the new disease can harm you

Under the skin
A fragile bone
Who'd strangle a wren
With the cord from a phone
Who wouldn't condone
That subtle kind of curfew

Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
We're living in a velveteen delusion

We'll be whatever we can make of it
Till we're real
Till we feel
Like we're real

Bleak thoughts are free
It fogs, it rains
Makes a come back at three
Paints some white on the stains
We haven't a pain
In the waning light of tuesday

What's in the sack?
A want or a need
Or special visions to track
On a pallet of reeds
You don't have to bleed
Like a roller skating junior

Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
We're living in a velveteen delusion

Later life 
Will be whatever we can make of it
Till we die
Look alive
Till we die


"The Last Television"

Bird songs sang
Not the last television
We flicker away 
Down to the sound

To stay or go
We do not know
Can't you stay
To lose the light of day

So long
The theme song is so very wrong
So take us away
Away


"If You Go To Sleep"

A sixty watt bulb
Illuminates the family tree
The doctor's taken to sea
A discolored paperback 
In an ancient galilee

A string of hard lives
They're laughing up their sleeves
They'd hang a man from a tree
A hidden heart attack
Brazen bellas in back seats

Sideways
The binding comes unglued
A sting we've often renewed 
Under the cover of sine waves
It's something we need anyway

Gently
Drown the plutocrats
Someone shivers? show them the bat
You can strike them off your list
And rule the village with a fist

Stop captain, stop
Do you not see, do you not see?
All the pages are torn off
Around high tea

Underground swell
By the church bells
We cannot sleep

Turn it around
Can't take the sound
Of your wet feet

No sleeping through the night
The doctors may have been right

To the third particle
The virus at high sea
Call sawbones
They cannot breathe

Sleeping
Breathing
Seething
Freezing

If you go to sleep
We will miss you

The doctor may be right
The doctor may be right
The doctor may be right
The doctor may be right


"If You Feel The Quiver"

That autumn when we rolled
The cargo to the hold
A haunting refrain
Of the winter campaign

We tried to hold the line
Down to ten and nine
Packed in the lee
Bent at the knee

If you feel the quiver
Head down to the river
The mighty and the wealthy
Need to keep their children healthy

A briny kit of gear
Angling from the pier
Bridled the team
And broke through the dream

If you feel the quiver
Head down to the river
The mighty and the wealthy
Need to keep their children healthy
Tonight



"Wood and Glass"

Shards of glass 
In the right hand
Or garden shears
Left by the dwarf Alberta

By the boxwood
By the corpse
Left by the topiary

In the toolshed
On the wall
Is god in tears
A nail is his hand

Wood and glass
Sand, pith, and mass
Canned paint and stain
Stand, smell the rain

Our luxury home
With all the paving stones
Welcomes guests with barks and purrs
The color of the stone is fool proof

The walls
A cool blue
And curved stair cases
Two


"Black Spruce"

Memories
They tend to follow you
Lagging strands behind the brand new

First we walked
And then we learned to crawl
Between the sheets to save us all

Chose a path
And got struck by a train
On a hillock green with grain

Our last truce
Beneath a dead black spruce


"Why Some Houses Burn"

Give the jib line some slack
As we lay on our backs
But keep a few rags
In our flight bag

Who can we trust?
Endless we dust!
Grind on the ring
As the digits are sliding

This is why some houses burn

The last pass was wrong by a furlong
Round and spikey beneath the gum tree

Fixed a broken bike spoke
Beneath the old willow oak
And told some dad jokes

This is why some houses burn

Wade through the stream
On a split screen
The future will sag
Raise a pink flag

How many, how many, how many

Someday we'll learn
Why some houses burn
In a downturn


"Element of Time"

A distant relation
A clattered bone

Lungs are floating
Through the frigid air
Time is slowing
Down your morning prayer

Mend the brickwork
Watch the church burn
Don't let go 
Let go

I've come to watch you burn
