"What's In Santa's Sack?"

Santa Claus
You've got the weight of the world
On your shoulders
Tax laws
You found your way around them
And you're only older

Santa Claus
We've got just one question for you
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Do you have a wish list, too?

Santa Claus
What do you want in your stocking this year?
Is it elven sweatshops
In a Mexican border town, far from here?
Or a hot dog with relish and mustard
And salsa and jalape√±os?

Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Do you have a wish list, too?

Snow falls in Texas only once a year
And sometimes not that often
So, Santa Claus
Why don't you come on down
And ignore all the Jews
Ho ho ho
Ho ho hey
Ho ho hobbledy who

Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Do you have a wish list, too?


"Show Me Your Fingers"

Have you changed my question?
Or do I want to dance right now?
I've abandoned my plans for Christmas
So that just you see

Show me your fingers
Count them, darling
That's how many times I've loved you
And nine times is enough for one man to do

I'm riding the bus to Paris, Texas
My love has never looked so cold
I live alone in Dallas
So that just you see

Show me your fingers
Count them, darling
That's how many times I've loved you
And nine times is enough for one man to do


"Christmas Eve Alone"

This happens every time you call my line
I've got plenty to say
About frat house propaganda
And the lengthening line
For contracting disease

It's Christmas Eve alone
But Sally's on the phone
I'm asking her about
The next time she's driving home

Sally Ann she's the sad one
But she smiles bright blue when I tell her the news
About how rescuers aren't working
It's Christmas eve so they can go home

About how Ronald Reagan's had back rubs
And lots of new friends for living this far
And with our senator in a space ship
Then who will speak for us while he's gone

It's Christmas Eve alone
But sally's on the phone
I'm asking her about
The next time she's driving home

And Sally says
Oh, I am a human being
With floors and ceilings
And doors like you
I've even got a kitchen
And a cat named Richard just like you
I know the names of your kinfolk
And have had mine renamed like yours
We've got the same initials
And now my birthday is the same as yours

It's Christmas Eve alone
But Sally's on the phone
I'm asking her about
The next time she's driving home


"It Was A Wonderful Life"

Driving home in my Buick
It is green like Christmas trees
It is a wonderful life

The road is black like lumps of coal
The road is striped like candy canes
Trees are blurred like banjo strings
It is a wonderful life

The sky is red like Christmas gifts
The signals blink like Christmas lights
It is a wonderful life

The hills ablaze like yule logs
The music blares like Mormon choirs
It is a wonderful life

It's Christmas time out on the plains
And the prairie dogs are singing at me
I'm in my car driving through the rain
Deer above signs reading Dallas is soon to be

Santa Claus out here he wears old chaps
And dons a Stetson hat
Bringing Christmas joy he wears that hat
And just like Alexander Rapstine

Santa Claus is here
Santa Claus is here
