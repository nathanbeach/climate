"A Fascinating Study Of Successful And Unsuccessful People"

This is a fascinating study
Of successful and unsuccessful people


"Saloth Sar No Cry"

Photo day
White washed gloves

Saloth Sar no cry
You looked perfect today
Saloth Sar no cry
Threw your TV's away

Waking up dead
With the poison tree
A Roman holiday
In the Kampuchea

Saloth Sar no cry
Don't hide your Jaw of Traitor
Saloth Sar no cry
Essence of the revolution

Saloth Sar say good bye
To Phnom Penh
And your Tuol Sleng friends


"The Family Dynasty"

Cunning wood shop grasp
Of the English language
Led to a family dynasty
And plundered economy

Demonstrations in the street
Fighting prostitutes in the city
700 a month turned to 100 million

Shot at a party
Where two sons
Rise in the wake
Of a violent earthquake

The assassinated poet
Was himself shot and killed
His body beaten
Spat upon
Dumped!

We buy blood
From the lower classes
Sell at huge markups
To American masses

I am smiling just the same

Bypass, bypass
You must use my concrete


"We Have Friends"

When you come home
Please come home to me
Someone will be waiting
With some cups of tea
Blessed celibacy

Dallas air field
Now called an "airport"
“DFW” for short
Blurried people
Head for the worthy fort
Others are the Dallas sort

Lots of people
Seem to go nowhere
Don't forget to share
No one has friends
When the do not share
Lonely like a bear

We have friends and are so friendly
We should win the Swiss presidency
We made Hitler like red army
Jimmy carter, he has nothing on me

I gotta go gotta go my memory's calling me
Turning the screws into the new history


"Hats Off To The Ceaușescus!"

Lifestyles and memories
False hopes and painted trees
My phone's stretched to the street
A high living standard
Broadcast on your tv

The bird's head
Sinks in the bird bath
The Sensotainment™, she said
We can't afford that
The peasants think that I'm mean
You gotta stay home
And feel my loving wrath

Ceaușescu and Emil Bobu
The airfield where I last held you
I say we go to the sea
You said our motto was
‘Nothing Without God’

The car chase catastrophe
You used to whisper under the bedsheets
I'd like my lawyer to speak
Our bloody corpses
Broadcast on your tv

[sample: Ceaușescu's final speech to the Romanian people]


"The Executive Spouse"

Filled up boxes with ship sails
Worked a while with a spade and a pail
Little reason to stay on the job
With all the people at cien águilas

Make time for our movie Lucia
Make time for our movie Lucia

In ’59 we started a home
Antofagasta with Esmeralda
If I succeed they'll promote me
Sub-director of the Acadamie

Make time for our movie Lucia
Make time for our movie Lucia

My rise to power has made me withdraw
From the miracle of shops, cars, and roads
What do i need lately?
A peaceful kitchen
And a hammer and nails

Make time for our movie Lucia
Make time for our movie Lucia
