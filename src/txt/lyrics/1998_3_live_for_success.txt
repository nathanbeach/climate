"Success and Failure"

This is a fascinating study
Of successful and unsuccessful people


"Office Politics"

Rinsing bottles of broken liquid
Washing them with soap like dirty dishes
Turn them into Camden Yards day game wishes
Fishes, Misha, mixing them with squid

Vladmir, don't cry
I have nothing to say

Representing rabbis in The Senate
Blessing all the children with freckles and hair
Beans are 50 rubles and 20 for the pears
Trousers extra long with cuffs, infinite

Vladmir, don't cry
I have nothing to say
Vladmir, don't cry
I have nothing to say


"Golf, Of Course"

I am smiling all the same


"A Special Word For The Professional Man"

I think everybody should give me a nut
As they pass by on the road
Passing cars and a truck
I think they should give me nuts
Because I deserve it
I live on this street
I feed out of its dumpsters
I have no home
I jump from building to building
Since there are no trees

Now I wander the streets no more
Flat like a wooden postcard
Rabid teeth protruding for not-severe tire-damage
Asphalt melted to one side of my cute furry body
Bushy tail brittle in the sun
I got A's in squirrel school
I am a wandering toll booth


"The Friendship Network"

When you come home
Please come home to me
Please go home with me
Someone's waiting with some cups of tea
Blessed celibacy

Dallas airfield
Now called an airport
"DFW" for short
Blurried people head for the worthy fort
Others are the Dallas sort

Lots of people seem to go nowhere
Don't forget to share
No-one has friends when they do not share
Lonely like a bear

We have friends and are so friendly
We should win the Swiss presidency
We made Hitler like the Red Army
Jimmy Carter ain't got nothing on me

I gotta’ go
I gotta’ go
My memory's calling me
Turning all the squares
Into the new history


"Practice For Success"

If you are awake, I would love for you to come on by!

You told me it wasn't even
You told me it was with some place downtown
Well I'm going to have to knock on your door or something

Okay, alright
Hello?
Goodbye

I am puzzled why your answering machine don't work

I asked a favor of you
Could you get my mail on the outside?
I didn't get through to you
I guess if you're awake
I would appreciate

I am puzzled why your answering machine don't work

It looks like you've finally come home
Your red car, it's back at the house
The note I left on the door is gone, it's missing
I don't know why you don't answer me

I am puzzled why your answering machine don't work

I am not sure whether or not you
Check your message service everyday
I thought I saw your car in the driveway in the shade at least
That's where it doesn't get so hot

I am puzzled why your answering machine don't work


"Being Liked"

You fly to Paris while I load my gun
And our three Chinese comrades are having such fun
I meant, you were what riding as you left my town?
Were you riding a horse or just messing around?
Don't speak that way, you're declining inflection
Only foreigners speak with such a lack of direction

Let's walk a while since all the free seats are taken
All the programs are bought and the play is forsaken
Legs cover ears up and I don't have to see
All the smells that increase my misogyny
My love is leaving why should she stay
Being pigeons at bedtime and sleeping all day

I'd rather wake than sleep for the fear
Of the wake of the morning sun

The inventors have been found
And the cobbler has no pie
And the old men have been checkered
And the blacksmith has been shoed
The morticians are dead
One too many in the head


"The Executive Spouse"

Hired a maid for the dishes
And one for cleaning
The house and cars
And a boy for the garden

Let's have some rich kids, Cindy
Let's make some rich kids, Cindy

Risking money on Wall Street
Cell phone users are saying
Buy low, sell high
While the market is closing

Let's have some rich kids, Cindy
Let's make some rich kids, Cindy

Shoes and furs and Mercedes
A wife's a great investment
In flesh and hair
And a nice set of toenails

Let's have some rich kids, Cindy
Let's make some rich kids, Cindy


"How To Overcome Your Own Background"

You're on your own
On your own for the next few days
Until you leave for West Virginia
Until you leave for West Virginia
You're invited every night
Every evening
After you get out of work
To have supper with me
And it is pretty simple

I just heat it up in the microwave
I don't have to do any cooking
But I have desserts
And I have drinks
I think maybe I can fatten you up
Just give me a call
Because it is definite
And I expect you to get over here

You are here
You are here
Thursday night
Friday night
Saturday night
Sunday night

And then you'll be gone
And then you'll be gone

When you pulled the plug out of my radio
Or whatever
That you brought over to me
You pulled out the wires
So that I can't reach back there
It's not urgent
But if you could come over
Call me first
I'll open the door
And you can stick the plug back in
Turn it up so I can feel
Turn it up so I can hear
Turn it up so I can feel
So I can't hear
I can't feel the radio

Just call me
Feel the call me

I want you to come on over
Take a little drink
And share supper with me
So let me know I got plenty to feed you
And feed you
And feed you
And feed you
You choose your meal
And I'll have it ready for you
Very quickly with desserts and drinks
Okay, with desserts
Okay, with drinks
Okay, with desserts
And drinks!

You choose your meal
And I'll have it ready for you
You choose your meal


"Key Attributes Employers Look for in New Hires, Pt. 2"

Beim nächsten Ton ist es 18:29:34

And the mothers have been born
The rosy offspring cooing screaming
Modern scientists all make discoveries
Of great importance

And the tailor has been altered
His pant cuffs are pressed
He mends the dress
He cannot complain
He must confess
Because modern scientists
All make discoveries of great importance
That make his life so easy

He had risen early
And the morning air was gently sneezing
Only on the window pane
Because he cannot go out again
Because life is now a computer

With a point ‘n’ click he shops for groceries
Orders friends
Meets porno stars
He is to blame for being poor
His sister's friends are in the country
Having a good time

She asked him whether he had seen
The frisky cat named Rump Machine
The door is closed at half-past nine
If he eats pears
And lives the lives of many Cuban gangsters

Hamsters wake at half-past six
And run around and do some tricks
The furniture cartel is growing
Haitian immigrants are rowing
Drinking taste plus value

Domesticated girls are grown
And Paco does not like to row
He has carried out his final plan
He sleeps on standard fitted sheets
On furniture from Cuba

And the water runs dry
And the water runs dry
And the water runs dry
And the water runs dry
Oh my


"Key Attributes Employers Look for in New Hires, Pt. 3"

You can dig my grave with a silver spade
There's a long white robe up in heaven for me
There's a starry crown up in heaven for me
There's a golden harp up in heaven for me
You can pluck one string and the whole heaven rings
Do you think I will make a soldier?
